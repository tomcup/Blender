Curve from Mesh/Text
====================

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Object Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Object --> Convert to --> Curve from Mesh/Text`

Mesh objects and text objects can be converted into curve objects.
In mesh objects, only edges belonging to no faces will be taken into account.
The resulting curve will be a Poly curve type, but can be converted to have
smooth segments as described in :ref:`curve-convert-type`.


Mesh from Curve/Metaball/Surface/Text
=====================================

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Object Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Object --> Convert to --> Mesh from Curve/Meta/Surf/Text`

Converts the selected curve, metaball, surface and text objects to mesh objects.
The actual defined resolution of these objects will be taken into account for the conversion.
Note that it also keeps the faces and volumes created by closed and extruded curves.


Grease Pencil from Curve/Mesh
=============================

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Object Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Object --> Convert to --> Grease Pencil from Curve/Mesh`

Converts the selected curve/mesh to a Grease Pencil object
with strokes matching the curve/mesh; basic materials are also add.
When multiple curves/meshes are selected, they are all converted into
the same Grease Pencil object.
