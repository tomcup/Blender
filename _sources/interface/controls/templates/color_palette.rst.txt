   Color Palette.

Color Palettes are a way of storing a brush's color so that it can be used at a later time.
This is useful when working with several colors at once.

Palette
   A :ref:`ui-data-block` to select a palette.

New ``+``
   Adds the current brush's primary *Color* to the palette.
Delete ``-``
   Removes the currently selected color from the palette.

Move (up/down arrow icon)
   Moves the selected color up/down one position.

Sort
   Sort Colors by Hue, Saturation, Value, Luminance.

Color List
   Each color that belongs to the palette is presented in a list.
   Clicking on a color will change the brush's primary *Color* to that color.


Shortcuts
=========

- :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` open the color picker to change color. See :ref:`ui-color-picker`.
- :kbd:`Backspace` reset the value.
