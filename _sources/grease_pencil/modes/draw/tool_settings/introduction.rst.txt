Common Options
==============

In the Tool Settings you can select the brush and material to use with the tool.

Brush
   The :ref:`ui-data-block` to select a preset brush type or a custom brush.
   See :ref:`Brush <grease-pencil-draw-brushes>` options.

Material
   Data-block selector for the :doc:`material </grease_pencil/materials/introduction>`.
   Except for the *Erase* tool of course.

   Pin Material (pin icon)
      Pin the material to the brush.

      The final appearance of the strokes is a combination of the brush and material used,
      binding the material to the brush gives more control and avoids a lack of coordination between the two.
