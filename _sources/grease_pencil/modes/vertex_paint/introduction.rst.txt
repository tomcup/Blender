Introduction

Vertex Painting is a simple way of painting color onto a Grease Pencil object,
by directly manipulating the color of points/vertices, rather than use only the materials base color.

   Stroke with original base material color (left) and with vertex painting (right).

When a point is painted, the color of the points is mixing with the base material color according to
the settings of the brush.

.. note::

   A vertex in Grease Pencil is called point. Point and vertex names are equivalent.

=================

Vertex Paint Mode is selected from the *Mode* menu in the 3D Viewport header.
