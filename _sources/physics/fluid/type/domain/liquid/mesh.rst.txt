Mesh
****

The liquid mesh is, besides the liquid particles, another way to visualize the liquid simulation.
It is generated directly from the liquid particles and often uses a higher resolution than
the base :ref:`Resolution Divisions <bpy.types.FluidDomainSettings.resolution_max>`.

Besides enabling parts of the interface, checking *Mesh* lets the cache know
which simulation data to read. If, for example, *Mesh* is enabled but
there is no mesh simulation data to read it will show the original domain.
The checkbox does not reset the cache and can be used to switch the view between
the original domain and the baked liquid mesh.

It is important to keep in mind that the shape of the mesh depends on a combination of *all* these
parameters. E.g. changing the :ref:`Particle Radius <bpy.types.FluidDomainSettings.resolution_max>`
will lead to a different interpretation of the concavity values.

.. _bpy.types.FluidDomainSettings.mesh_scale:

Upres Factor
   Factor by which to enhance the resolution of the mesh. The scaling factor is coupled to
   the :ref:`Resolution Divisions <bpy.types.FluidDomainSettings.resolution_max>`
   (i.e. the mesh is this times bigger than the base simulation).

.. _bpy.types.FluidDomainSettings.mesh_particle_radius:

Particle Radius
   The radius of one liquid particle in grid cells units. This value describes how much area is covered
   by a particle and thus determines how much area around it can be considered as liquid.
   A greater radius will let particles cover more area. This will result in meshes covering more
   volume around liquid particles.

   This property refers to the same :ref:`Particle Radius <bpy.types.FluidDomainSettings.particle_radius>`
   described in the liquid domain settings. Yet for the mesh, it is useful to interpret
   the particle radius on its own. For one, the mesh can have a resolution different from the base
   resolution through the :ref:`Upres Factor <bpy.types.FluidDomainSettings.mesh_scale>`. For another,
   it is often desirable to be able to control the mesh size around a single liquid particle.

.. _bpy.types.FluidDomainSettings.use_speed_vectors:

Use Speed Vectors
   If this checkbox is enabled, speed vectors (mesh vertex velocities) are generated and stored on
   drive. They can be used to compute image-based motion blur with the compositing nodes.

             Motion blur disabled.

.. _bpy.types.FluidDomainSettings.mesh_generator:

Mesh Generator
   The mesh generator method determines the accuracy of the mesh. The *Final* option produces a higher
   quality mesh and provides more configuration option than the *Preview* option which in turn is
   faster but not as smooth.

.. _bpy.types.FluidDomainSettings.mesh_smoothen_pos:

Smoothing Positive
   Positive mesh smoothing iterations. Higher values will make the mesh outline increasingly smooth.
   Yet higher values can prevent small details (e.g. smaller liquid drops) from getting meshed.

.. _bpy.types.FluidDomainSettings.mesh_smoothen_neg:

Smoothing Negative
   Negative mesh smoothing iterations. Higher values will make the mesh outline sharper.
   High values will preserve details, however, the mesh outline will become more ragged
   (e.g. a single mesh particle will become less rounded and have more flat sides).

      Note the slightly sharper corners in the right splash (compared to the left one).

.. _bpy.types.FluidDomainSettings.mesh_concave_upper:

Concavity Upper
   Upper mesh concavity bound. High values tend to smoothen and fill out concave regions.

.. _bpy.types.FluidDomainSettings.mesh_concave_lower:

Concavity Lower
   Lower mesh concavity bound. High values tend to smoothen and fill out concave regions.

   Using a lower concavity which is greater the upper concavity can result in distorted, non-manifold meshes.
   Unless the artist sees value in this kind of mesh, such concavity value combinations should be avoided.

   .. list-table:: Crown splash with varying upper and lower concavity settings. Note that setting
      the concavity values to the same value produces a very granular mesh.

Bake Mesh, Free Mesh
   This option is only available when using the :ref:`Modular <bpy.types.FluidDomainSettings.cache_type>`
   cache type.

   The progress will be displayed in the status bar. Pressing :kbd:`Esc` will abort the simulation.

   Once the simulation has been baked, the cache can be deleted by pressing *Free Mesh*.
   It is possible to pause or resume a *Bake Mesh* process.
