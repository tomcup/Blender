Installing from Steam
*********************

Steam is a software distribution platform. Blender can be downloaded and updated
using the Steam client by following the steps described below on Linux, macOS, or Windows.

Download the `Steam client <https://store.steampowered.com/>`__ for your operating system.
Once installed, open the client and login to your Steam account, or create one if you haven't already.
Once logged in, navigate to the *Store* tab, search for "Blender", and press the green installation button.
Blender should now be available in the *Library* tab of the Steam client.

   When installing Blender from Steam on Linux and Windows, the ``.blend`` filename extension will not
   be automatically associated with Blender. To associate blend-files with Blender, see the processes
   described on the :doc:`Linux </getting_started/installing/linux>` and
   :doc:`Windows </getting_started/installing/windows>` installation pages.


Updating with Steam
===================

When an update for Blender is available on Steam, Steam will automatically update Blender for you.
