   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Draw Face Sets`

This brush draws a new :ref:`Face Set <sculpting-editing-facesets>` with each stroke.
Holding :kbd:`Ctrl` will continue drawing the same Face Set as the one under the cursor.
Holding :kbd:`Shift` will relax or smooth the edges of the Face Sets
by modifying the underlying topology so edges flow along the perimeter of the Face Sets.
This will remove the jagged lines visible after drawing or creating a Face Set.
