Similar to the *Clay* brush, but it uses a cube to define the brush area of influence rather than a sphere.

Tip Roundness
   Factor to control how round the brush is, a value of zero will make the brush square.
   Note, the :doc:`Brush Falloff </sculpt_paint/brush/falloff>`
   is only applied to the rounded portions of the brush.
