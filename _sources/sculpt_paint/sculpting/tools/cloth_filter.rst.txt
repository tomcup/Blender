.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Cloth Filter`

This tool works similar to the :doc:`Cloth Brush </sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/cloth>`,
however, it applies a cloth simulation to all vertices in the mesh at the same time.
Click and drag away from the object for a positive effect and towards for a negative effect.

.. tip::

   Vertices can be "pinned" by :doc:`masking </sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/mask>` vertices
   that should remain stationary, or by using :ref:`Face Sets <sculpting-editing-facesets>`.

Filter Type
   Operation that is going to be applied to the mesh.

   Gravity
      Applies gravity to the simulation.
   Inflate
      Inflates the cloth.
   Expand
      Expands the cloth's dimensions.
   Pinch
      Pinches the cloth to the point were the cursor was when the filter started.

Strength
   The amount of effect the filter has on the mesh.

Cloth Mass
   Mass of each simulation particle.

Cloth Damping
   How much the applied forces are propagated through the cloth.

Use Face Sets
   Only applies the mesh filter to the vertices assigned to the :ref:`Face Set <sculpting-editing-facesets>`
   that is under the mouse.
