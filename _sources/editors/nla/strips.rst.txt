Strips
******

There are four kinds of strips: Action, Transition, Sound clip and Meta.


Action Strips
=============

An Action Strip is a container of keyframe data of an action.
Any action used by the NLA first must be turned into an Action strip.
This is done so by clicking the Push Down action button see above.
Alternatively, you can go to :menuselection:`Add --> Action Strip`.


Transition Strips
=================

Transitions interpolate between Actions. They must be placed in between other strips.
Select two or more strips on the same track,
and go to :menuselection:`Add --> Transition`.

   Transition Strip.


Sound Clip Strips
=================

Controls when a speaker plays a sound clip.
:menuselection:`Add --> Sound Clip`.


Meta Strips
===========

Meta strips group strips together as a whole, so you can move them as one.
If you find yourself moving a lot of strips together, you can group them into a Meta strip.
A Meta strip can be moved and duplicated like a normal strip.

          Combine them into a meta strip.

A Meta strip still contains the underlying strips. You can ungroup a Meta strip.
